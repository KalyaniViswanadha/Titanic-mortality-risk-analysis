Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Objective\n\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\nIn this challenge, we are going to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.\n\n### 1.2 Data Understanding\n\nTo download data, click [here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\n\nThe data has been split into two groups:\n\n* training set (train.csv)\n* test set (test.csv)\n\nThe training set is used to build machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n\n**Data Dictionary**\n\n| Variable  |  Definition | Key  |   \n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| survival  |  Survival   |  0 = No, 1 = Yes |  \n|  pclass\t |  Ticket class |  1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd |  \n|  sex |  Sex |   |   \n|  Age |   Age in years |   |  \n|  sibsp |  # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic |   |   \n| parch  | # of parents / children aboard the Titanic  |   |   \n|  ticket | Ticket number  |   |  \n|  fare | Passenger fare  |   |   \n| cabin  |  Cabin number  |   |   \n| embarked  | Port of Embarkation  |C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton   |   \n\n**Variable Notes**\n\npclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n1st = Upper\n2nd = Middle\n3rd = Lower\n\nage: Age is fractional if less than 1.
