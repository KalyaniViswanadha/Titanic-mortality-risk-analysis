# Titanic Survival Analysis

This repository contains a predictive analysis of survival rates on the Titanic dataset. The goal of this analysis is to predict which passengers survived the tragic sinking of the Titanic based on various features available in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the famous "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about passengers who were onboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset is divided into two files: `train.csv` (used for training the models) and `test.csv` (used for evaluating the models).

##Methodology:

Construct training data frame
â€¢	Logistic Regression
â€¢	Random Forest
â€¢	Decision Tree
â€¢	SVM


## Analysis

The analysis is performed in Jupyter Notebook, and the code can be found in the `Titanic_Survival_Analysis.ipynb` file. The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and explore its structure, missing values, and summary statistics.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, perform feature engineering, and prepare the dataset for modeling.
3. Data Visualization: Visualize the relationships between various features and the target variable (survived) to gain insights.
4. Model Building: Build and train machine learning models to predict passenger survival.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics.
6. Model Selection: Choose the best model based on evaluation results.
